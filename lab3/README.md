# Lab 3 - Spline Interpolation

The goal of this laboratory exercise was to implement and compare two methodes of interpolating functions - Cubic and Quadratic Spline

Given function used as an interpolated example:
$f(x) = e^{-3sin(3x)}$

The `lab3.py` file was used for some tests. The code and laboratory's report can be found in `lab3.ipynb` file
