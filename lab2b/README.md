# Lab 2 b - Interpolation

The goal of this laboratory exercise was to implement and test Hermite's methode of interpolating functions

Given function used as an interpolated example:
$f(x) = e^{-3sin(3x)}$

The `lab2b.py` file was used for some tests. The code and laboratory's report can be found in `lab2b.ipynb` file
