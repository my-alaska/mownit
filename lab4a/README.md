# Lab 4 a - Least Squares Approximation

The goal of this laboratory exercise was to implement and test a Least Squares methode of approximating functions

Given function used as an approximation example:
$f(x) = e^{-3sin(3x)}$

The `lab4a.py` file was used for some tests. The code and laboratory's report can be found in `lab4a.ipynb` file
