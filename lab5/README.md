# Lab 5 - Linear Equation

This laboratory consisted of 2 tasks:

### Task 1
Implementation and comparison of Secant method and Newton's method for solving linear equations and testing them on a given example:
$f(x) = 30xe^{-10}-30e^{-10x}+\dfrac{1}{30}$

### Task 2
Implementation and testing of Newton's method for solving a system of equations with an given example:
$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3 = 1$
$2x_1^2 - x_2^2 - 4x_3^2 = -3$
$x_1^2 + x_2 + x_3 = 1$

### Code
The code for tasks 1 and 2 can be found in `lab5z1.py` and `lab5z2.py` files consecutively
