# Lab 4 b - Least Squares Trigonometric 

The goal of this laboratory exercise was to implement and test a Least Squares methode of approximating functions with trigonometric polynomial

Given function used as an approximation example:
$f(x) = e^{-3sin(3x)}$

The `lab4b.py` file was used for some tests. The code and laboratory's report can be found in `lab4b.ipynb` file
