# Lab 2 a - Interpolation

The goal of this laboratory exercise was to implement and compare two methodes of interpolating functions - Lagrange's and Newton's and introduce students to problems posed by Runge's phenomenon

Given function used as an interpolated example:
$f(x) = e^{-3sin(3x)}$

The `lab2a.py` file was used for some tests. The code and laboratory's report can be found in `lab2a.ipynb` file
